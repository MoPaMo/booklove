# booklove

Swift code for the BookLove app (in development, only placeholder content/no server interactions as of now but design system is working + buttons have actions)

 booklove. - new books, new friends. 
 Booklove will allow you to discover new books, find people who read similar books and create book lists.
 



## getting started
I don't have an Apple Developer license yet, so you'll have to compile it yourself (I'm sorry xD)
Just clone the project and open it in XCode on your Mac.
